# Gilded Rose

I refactored the classic Gilded Rose Kata in TypeScript using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
My goal was to clean up the legacy code, improve readability, and apply Separation of Concerns to make the system easier to maintain and extend.

Through small, incremental changes guided by tests, I focused on isolating responsibilities, reducing code duplication, and ensuring that every refactor preserved the original behavior.
This exercise was a great way to strengthen my understanding of TDD, refactoring techniques, and clean code design in a legacy codebase.

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Run the unit tests from the Command-Line

There are two unit test frameworks to choose from, Jest and Mocha.

```sh
yarn run jest
```

To run all tests in watch mode

```sh
yarn run jest:watch
```
